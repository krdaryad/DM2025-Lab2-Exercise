Unstructured data is described as more complex and varied, usually derived from human-generated content like text, images, and videos."

Structured data is you know exactly the meaning about the row and column. Unstructured data is they will change. Sometimes you don't really know how to interpret them. Currently that the human generated content such as image, text, video, we consider them as unstructured data. But you still need to be able to know.",

Your data is sparse in that data record. Because they have millions of the record, millions of the book. But then you probably only buy 10 books before. So make your data in the million then become very sparse. So data are sparse. And then sometimes in certain place, we will also talking about the resolution. And that part about sparsity, how to solving them, how to do the resolution, we will talking about later in some of the courses.

And then after that, for every document, you utilize those important keyword, we got some number, occurrence of the number for that keyword right there. We generate a something called term vector. So each one of them are human vector. Why vector? Because in computer science, vector is the easiest way for us to operate. We convert them to vector.
