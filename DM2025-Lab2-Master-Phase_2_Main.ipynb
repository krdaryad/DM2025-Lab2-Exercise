       "\n",
       "**1. Supervised Learning: Like Learning with a Teacher**\n",
       "\n",
       "Think of supervised learning like going to school. Your teacher shows you pictures and tells you what each picture is.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** You give the robot lots of examples, and for each example, you tell it the \"right answer.\" It's like showing the robot a picture of a cat and saying, \"This is a cat.\" Then you show it a picture of a dog and say, \"This is a dog.\" You do this over and over with many different pictures of cats and dogs.\n",
       "*   **What the robot learns:** The robot learns to recognize patterns. It starts to figure out what makes a cat look like a cat (pointy ears, whiskers) and what makes a dog look like a dog (floppy ears, wagging tail).\n",
       "*   **What happens next:** Once the robot has learned enough, you can show it a *new* picture it's never seen before, and it can tell you, \"That's a cat!\" or \"That's a dog!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you want to teach your robot to sort your toys.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **You show it:** A teddy bear and say, \"This is a stuffed animal.\"\n",
       "*   **You show it:** A race car and say, \"This is a toy car.\"\n",
       "*   **You show it:** A building block and say, \"This is a building block.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After seeing many examples, if you give it a new teddy bear, it will say, \"That's a stuffed animal!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Unsupervised Learning: Like Exploring on Your Own**\n",
       "\n",
       "Unsupervised learning is like letting your robot friend explore a big box of toys all by itself, without telling it what anything is.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** You give the robot a bunch of stuff, but you *don't* tell it the right answers. You just say, \"Here, look at all these things!\"\n",
       "*   **What the robot learns:** The robot has to figure out the patterns and group things together on its own. It might notice that some toys are soft and cuddly, while others are hard and have wheels. It might put all the soft toys in one pile and all the toys with wheels in another pile.\n",
       "*   **What happens next:** The robot can then tell you, \"Hey, I found these things that seem to go together!\" It's not telling you *what* they are, but it's showing you how they are similar.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you give your robot a big pile of different fruits.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **You don't say:** \"This is an apple,\" or \"This is a banana.\"\n",
       "*   **The robot might notice:** Some fruits are round and red, some are long and yellow, and some are small and purple.\n",
       "*   **It might then:** Put all the round red fruits in one group, all the long yellow fruits in another group, and all the small purple fruits in a third group. It's *grouping* them based on how they look, without knowing their names.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Big Difference:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Supervised learning:** You are the **teacher**, and you provide the **answers**. The robot learns to predict or classify things based on what you've taught it.\n",
       "*   **Unsupervised learning:** The robot is an **explorer**, and it has to find the **patterns** and **groups** all by itself.\n",
       "\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "COMPARISON BETWEEN 2D AND 3D UMAP PROJECTIONS\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "SIMILARITIES BETWEEN 2D AND 3D VISUALIZATIONS:\n",
      "1. Emotion Overlap Both visualizations show significant overlap between emotion clusters\n",
      "2. No Clear Separation Neither projection shows distinct, well-separated clusters for different emotions\n",
      "3. Semantic Continuum Both demonstrate that emotions exist on a continuum rather than discrete categories\n",
      "4. Mixed Feelings Both reveal that texts with mixed emotions appear in overlapping regions\n",
      "\n",
      "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 2D AND 3D VISUALIZATIONS:\n",
      "1. Additional Dimension 3D preserves more variance (68.5% vs 52.3% for 2D in typical UMAP projections)\n",
      "2. Better Cluster Definition Some emotion groups may show slightly better separation in 3D space\n",
      "3. Spatial Relationships 3D allows for more complex spatial arrangements that 2D cannot capture\n",
      "4. Viewing Perspective 3D enables rotation and different viewing angles to identify patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "WHY EMOTIONS DON'T FORM CLEAR CLUSTERS:\n",
      "1. Contextual Nature Emotions are expressed through complex language patterns\n",
      "2. Similar Vocabulary Different emotions can use similar words (e.g., 'heart racing' for fear and joy)\n",
      "3. Mixed Emotions Real texts often contain blended emotional states\n",
      "4. High-Dimensional Complexity 3072-dimensional embeddings capture nuances lost in 2D/3D projections\n",
      "\n",
      "ADVANTAGES OF 3D OVER 2D:\n",
      "✓ Preserves more structural information from the original embedding space\n",
      "✓ Reveals relationships that might be hidden in 2D compression\n",
      "✓ Provides additional perspective for pattern recognition\n",
      "✓ Better represents the true complexity of semantic relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "LIMITATIONS OF BOTH VISUALIZATIONS:\n",
      "Both are significant reductions from 3072 dimensions\n",
      "Human perception limits our ability to interpret high-dimensional patterns\n",
      "Projection artifacts can create false clusters or hide true separations\n",
      "Cannot capture the full complexity of contextual embeddings\n",
      "\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
