        # LECTURE ANALYSIS: Data Sets and Their Characteristics
## Video Segment: 110:58 - 114:58

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide is titled &quot;Data Sets&quot; and lists two main types: Structured Data Sets and Unstructured Data Sets. Structured data is described as organized in certain formats, often in rows and columns, with a clear, predictable structure. Unstructured data is described as more complex and varied, usually derived from human-generated content like text, images, and videos.

[TRANSCRIPT - 110:58]
So the next one we want to talking about the data set. We have different type of data set. You might heard about the term called structured data or unstructured data. <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Structured data is you know exactly the meaning about the row and column.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Unstructured data is they will change. Sometimes you don&#x27;t really know how to interpret them. Currently that the human generated content such as image, text, video, we consider them as unstructured data.</span> But you still need to be able to know.

[TRANSCRIPT - 111:53]
So we have different kind of characteristic about our data dimension we mentioned before. Later. So we will talking about the resolution and that part about parsing. Some of them will be in classification, some of them will be in the text mining.

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide is titled &quot;Characteristics of Data Sets&quot; and lists three characteristics: Dimensionality (Curse of Dimensionality), Sparsity (Only presence counts), and Resolution (Patterns depend on the scale). A speech bubble with &quot;Later&quot; is present.

[TRANSCRIPT - 111:58]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Sparsity comes from a key word called sparse. Mean very few. Like what we say that if you have the record in e-commerce store, like in Amazon. Your data is sparse in that data record. Because they have millions of the record, millions of the book. But then you probably only buy 10 books before. So make your data in the million then become very sparse.</span> So data are sparse. And then sometimes in certain place, we will also talking about the resolution. And that part about sparsity, how to solving them, how to do the resolution, we will talking about later in some of the courses. Some of them will be in classification, some of them will be in the text mining.

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide is titled &quot;Types of Data Sets&quot; and lists three types: Record, Document Data, and Transaction Data. A visual representation of a &quot;Data Matrix&quot; is shown with columns for &quot;Book&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, &quot;Sell&quot;, &quot;# Reviews&quot;, and &quot;# Readers&quot;, and rows for &quot;Book 1&quot; through &quot;Book 5&quot; with corresponding numerical values. An arrow points to the &quot;# Readers&quot; column with the label &quot;Vector&quot;.

[TRANSCRIPT - 112:58]
We have different type of the data set. We have the data matrix, document data, transaction data. So <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">data matrix look like this way. If your data can be convert into meaningful number, they can become data metric. And then we allow them to do the ratio operation. They are called data matrix.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">To make sure all the value inside need to become the ratio data. If not, then all your matrix will become something wrong, very very wrong. So then right here, they need to be ratio data.</span>

[TRANSCRIPT - 114:48]
Okay. And the document data is a part that we were talking about later because before 2013, this is before 2013. Okay. And the people actually utilize document data in a vector form. Right here. So <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">they select important keyword in the document. And then after that, for every document, you utilize those important keyword, we got some number, occurrence of the number for that keyword right there. We generate a something called term vector.</span> So each one of them are human vector. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Why vector? Because in computer science, vector is the easiest way for us to operate. We convert them to vector.</span> So in other word, every number right here are become ratio data.

[TRANSCRIPT - 114:44]
Okay. But that is way we try to work in on that before 2013. After 2013, how we try to do that? We will talking about that that in the text mining part also. Maybe three weeks later.
